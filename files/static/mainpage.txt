'''Wikidata''' aims to create a free knowledge base about the world that can be read and edited by humans and machines alike. It will provide data in all the languages of the Wikimedia projects, and allow for the central access to data in a similar vein as Wikimedia Commons does for multimedia files.

= What can I see here? =
This is the demo of the current state of Wikidata development. Feel free to play around. Please keep in mind that this is a demo system.

'''You probably want to look at the demo of the repo part of Wikidata too. You can find it [http://wikidata-test-repo.wikimedia.de here].'''

= What can I try out? =
One simple workflow you can try out is to create a new entry in the repo-wiki and the create a matching article in the client-wiki. The client-wiki page will have all the language links on the left side you added on the repo-wiki.

# Go to the repo and add a new item. The label you choose must be equal to the title of the page you will create in the client-wiki.
# Add some language links in the repo-wiki to existing Wikipedias. '''Be sure to add language links to English (en) or the client-wiki won't try to find the interwiki links.'''
# Create a new article with the label you used in the client-wiki.
# Once you save the page you should see the language links you added to the repo-wiki on the left side.
